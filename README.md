## PixelEvolution ðŸ§¬âœ¨

Dive into a world where evolution unfolds in pixels!

[Add a short video demo here]

PixelEvolution is an AI-generated simulation where organisms adapt and thrive (or perish!) in a virtual environment. Originally crafted by Claude 3.5 Sonnet with just a few prompts, this project is now open for exploration and improvement.

### How It Works

* **Randomly Generated Organisms:** Each organism starts with a unique color and set of traits (speed, energy).
* **Resource Consumption:** Organisms seek out white food particles to replenish energy.
* **Reproduction and Mutation:** Organisms with enough energy reproduce, and their offspring inherit traits with a chance of mutation.
* **Natural Selection:** Organisms that can't find enough food or adapt to the environment die off.

### Get Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `PixelEvolution.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the controls to adjust parameters like speed, food scarcity, mutation rate, and environment.
4. Click "Start" to watch the simulation unfold!

### Features

* **Real-time Simulation:** Observe evolution as it happens.
* **Interactive Controls:** Experiment with different parameters.
* **Leaderboard:** Track the top 5 most successful species.

### To-Do List & Ideas for Improvement ðŸ”§ðŸ’¡

* **Responsive UI/Viewport:** Make the interface and canvas adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Contrasting Colors:** Ensure organisms and food are easily visible against the background.
* **Enhanced UI Design:** Create a more polished and intuitive user interface.
* **Collapsible Side/Top Panel:** Improve layout on smaller screens.
* **End-of-Simulation Stats:** Display detailed information and charts about the final population.
* **Save/Replay Simulations:** Allow users to save interesting runs and watch them again.
* **Additional Parameters:** Introduce new factors influencing evolution, such as predation or environmental changes.
* **More AI Integration:** Explore ways to further leverage AI in the simulation (e.g., AI-driven behavior, adaptive environments).

Your ideas are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or discuss improvements in the repository.
